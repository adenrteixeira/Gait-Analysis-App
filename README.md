# Instruction manual

## Installation
We recommend the use of anaconda since it was where these apps were developed.
You need to have MATLAB installed on your computer.

Feel free to change the name. I used the Python 3.10.4
> conda create --name APPGait python 

Activate the created enviroment

> conda activate APPGait

Then install the requirements with pip

> pip install -r requeriments.txt

Then you will have the capacity to open and execute the apps.

## Instructions
There are two apps in here. ReferenceGraphs_2.py and CompareRefPat.py. Any other file exists due to dependency of these two apps.

To open them do:

> python ReferenceGraphs_2.py

Or for the other one:

> python CompareRefPat.py
